If you need to switch between Bash and Zsh (and then perhaps to Bash),
you might like to use switchBashZsh.

In your computer user account, download the package for switchBashZsh,
and then execute switchBashZsh as a command. On first run, switchBashZsh
will create the filesystem hierarchy it needs.

Then you do the hard work - setting up your complete shell environment
as you would like it to be in future. If you later switch to the other
shell (Bash <-> Zsh), your shell environment will continue to work
exactly as it is.

You can even switch to a different computer with a different operating
system, you will still have the power to have your master shell
environment being back in action in a jiffy: switchBashZsh works across
FreeBSD/Linux/Cywgin. All you need to do in a new system is execute
switchBashZsh and then copy over your master ~/.shell directory.

If you like switchBashZsh, don't forget to email the author.
