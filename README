If you need to switch between Bash and Zsh (and then perhaps to Bash), you
might like to use switchBashZsh.

switchBashZsh makes it convenient to switch between these two shells.

In your computer user account, download the package switchBashZsh, and
then execucute switchBashZsh as a command.

switchBashZsh will create the filesystem hierarchy it needs. Then you
set up your complete shell environment as you would like it to be in
future. If you later switch to the other shell (Bash <-> Zsh), then your
previous shell environment with the previous shell will continue to work
exactly as it is.

You can even switch to a different computer with a different operating
system, you will still have the power to have your master shell
environment being back in action in a jiffy.

If you like switchBashZsh, don't forget to email the author.
